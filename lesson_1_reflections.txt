How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug ?

it was helpfule because it saved me alot of time and effort by speeding the 
comparing process which helped me to spot the bug faster.




How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
it can he;p me to back up my files
and if one copy get lost , bugged , deleted or damaged i don not lose the entire code
i can save a copy of my code every realese so i can check if there is a bug i should know it is in the new code
and i can compare the old copy with the new copy to check the modifications



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  
cons
1- i maybe add alote of copies so the history will be clutterd
2- i may forget to keep a copy and i will not be able to track my changes on the code
3-google docs may save copies i do not need


pros

1-i control when to save as i devide the code into functions or purposes
2- i can track by the note i write when i make a commit
 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others,
 like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 

maybe because on git you can save a code and a programme may have files related with each other
so when ou change something in one file the other may or may not be effected !!


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
1-i first go to the directory that the file exists on using CD change directory
2-use git log to start viewing the commits from the latest one 
3-press enter or down arrow until i found the required commit
4-press q to exit 
5- use git diff id ofrequird commit id of the previous one 
6-count the - red and the green + for the deleted and added lines 



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?


because i know that i can return to the previous commit with out losing my code and it helps me
locate where is the bug maybe by comparing the commits after usng git checkout
and running the commits one by one until i locate the error and use git diff to see what i changed



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  
i want to try writing my own codes and creating my repository with android studio
