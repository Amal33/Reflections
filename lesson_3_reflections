When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
1-if there were more than one person working on the project
2-if i am going to change my laptop or any thing goes wrong with the files on my computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because i may change the code and it is not ready yet 
then i wanted to discard the changes
